/*
 * Naming Conventions
 * You can't start with number.
 * You can use only underscore (_) or, dollar ($) symbol.
 * You can't use spaces.
 * Start with small letter and use camelCase.
 * Camel Case means when we use small case as first character and upper case character for new word like firstName, lastName etc.
 * Snake case means when we use underscore (_) between words in a multi-word string like first_name, last_name etc.
